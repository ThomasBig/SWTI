Installation The installation of SWTI library is easy. Download repository and copy the folder SWTI/swti to your project folder. It contains header and source code for the library. In your application, include a header \"#include swti/swti.hpp\" . Visual Studio - you will need to add header and source files to your project. Right click on the right folder header files and add existing file and choose SWTI/swti.h . Do the same for source files and add SWTI/swti.cpp . Code Blocks - click the left pane folders and add existing header and source files to your project. G++ Console - You can then use following two commands g++ -c main.cpp swti/swti.cpp and g++ -o main.exe main.o swti.o to compile your project. Change main.cpp and main.exe to whatever you prefer. Hello world You can use this simple example to ensure that SWTI library is installed correctly. Following code writes colorful Hello world on a specified position. It uses the Cursor object and methods setColor and setPosition. #include <iostream> #include \"swti/swti.hpp\" int main() { Cursor.setColor(YELLOW); Cursor.setPosition(5, 2); std::cout << \"Hello world!\" << std::endl; } Troubleshooting If something doesn't work, try to create a new project without any additional libraries other than SWTI. If you succeed, the problem is collision with function names in the library. In C++ functions or objects with same names cannot be used and namespace should be used. To solve this issue, you can create one for swti, in which you include a header and the source file. #include <iostream> namespace swti { #include \"swti/swti.hpp\" #include \"swti/swti.cpp\" // source is needed } int main() { swti::Color color = swti::LIGHTGREEN; swti::Cursor.setColor(color); std::cout << \"SWTI Works!\\n\"; } You need to use swti:: prefix for every function and object.

It is used every time you write a text. It is changed automatically but setting it manually provides a useful custom functionality. The unit of position is a single character . You set position of cursor by calling a function with specified number of columns and rows . The top left corner of the window is marked as [0,0] or more precisely x = 0 and y = 0 . The opposite bottom right corner can be obtained using Window functions. The character count of the window tells you many characters you can write in the current console without. Characters are not screen pixels . The actual character size in pixels depends on many factors including screen size and font size . The default value is about 16\u00d724 pixels large. Also check out the font information. Color Cursor color can be used to highlight different texts and to make simple graphics. There are 16 different colors to choose from.

It is the color which is at the moment in use. Font Font includes font size and font type. You can't have in one application characters of different sizes and fonts. Setting font changes all text in console therefore should be called at the start of the application. A good practice is to change a font only at the start of an application. Font size is measured by size of one character. When setting a new font size you should be using a setFontSize() or setFontChars() . These functions change font size in respect of the console window size. It makes porting application to different screen size much more easier. For headers and large texts you can use a ASCII Text generator. When printing any ascii art, do not forget to add escape characters.

Cursor.setPosition(5,2); Cursor.setColor(YELLOW); std::cout << \"Hello world!\" << std::endl; These are examples show usage of colors. Cursor.setColor(MAGENTA, LIGHTCYAN); Cursor.printChar(12, 3, 'D', GREEN); Cursor.printChar(4, 9, FILL_F, GREEN); Window.setColor(CURRENT, WHITE); These are examples where usage of font. Cursor.setFontSize(22); Cursor.setFontType(\"Lucida Console\"); std::cout << \"Printing some text\"; Functions bool setPosition(int x, int y) This function sets the position of cursor. When you call any standard function to print a text, first character will be on the set position. Next characters will continue right and down. The cursor position will not change if given position is outside the console window. Parameters int x - position in columns int y - position in rows Return value Return type is bool . Return value is true if position was set successfully or position is outside the console window. Return value is false if unexpected error occurs. Example This example sets the cursor position to coordinates [12, 8] and writes there using C++ standard output, printf and putchar. Cursor.setPosition(12, 8); std::cout << \"Hello \"; printf(\"world\"); putchar('!'); bool setColor(Color foreground, Color background=CURRENT) This function sets the color of cursor. It changes the foreground color of the printed characters and optionally you can also specify a background color. This function doesn't change already written characters (you can use Window.setColor() for that). Parameters Color - any color constant, foreground text color Color - (optional) any color, default is current background text color Return value Return type is bool . Return value is true if color was set successfully, false if any error occurs. Example This example writes two texts on the screen. First is a yellow text without specific background color, second is magenta text with light cyan background. Cursor.setColor(YELLOW); std::cout << \"Yellow text without background color\"; Cursor.setColor(MAGENTA, LIGHTCYAN); std::cout << \"Magenta text on light cyan background\"; bool setFontSize(int size) This function sets the height of characters in console. It calculates size proportionally to current console size. It is the most convenient and easy way to set the font size. Setting font size changes all text in console. Parameters int - new character height. Size 15 is approximately 1/50 of the console height. Return value Return type is bool . Return value is true if font was set successfully, false if any error occurs. Example This example writes a text on screen with size of 28. Then it waits for user input. After user presses a key, it resizes the console size and adjusts the font size to new console size. Cursor.setFontSize(28); std::cout << \"Press a key to change the screen size...\" << std::endl; Keyboard.waitUser(); Window.setSizePixels(1280,720); Cursor.setFontSize(28); bool setFontChars(int columns, int rows) This function sets the font size in console. It calculates size proportionally to a given screen columns and rows. Setting font size changes all text in console. Parameters int - at most how many columns will font occupy int - at most how many rows will font occupy Return value Return type is bool . Return value is true if font was set successfully, false if any error occurs. Example This example sets the font to squares and writes a filled tic tac toe board. Window.setSizeChars(100, 50); Cursor.setFontChars(50, 50); std::cout << \"XOX\\nOXO\\nXOX\" << std::endl; bool setFontPixels(int width, int height) This function sets the font size in console. It sets the font equal to pixels. The result of this function depends heavily on console screen size in pixels. You probably should use pixel independent functions like setFontSize or setFontChars . Setting font size changes all text in console. Parameters int - width of font in pixels int - height of font in pixels Return value Return type is bool . Return value is true if font was set successfully, false if any error occurs. Example This example sets the font to Window.setSizeChars(100, 50); Cursor.setFontChars(50, 50); std::cout << \"XOX\\nOXO\\nXOX\" << std::endl; bool setFontType(string name) This function sets the font in console. The most common fonts are Consolas , Courier , Lucida Console , MS Gothic , Terminal . Setting font changes all text in console. More information about fonts is here . Parameters string - name of font as standard string. You can call this function without creating variable (see example) Return value Return type is bool . Return value is true if font was set successfully, false if any error occurs. Example This example sets the font to Lucida Console and then changes the font size. Notice that the string is created using simple \"Lucida Console\" . Cursor.setFontType(\"Lucida Console\"); Cursor.setFontSize(28); bool printChar(int x, int y, int character, Color color=CURRENT) This function prints one character on specified position. Additionally it can change a cursor color. To print a blank character you can use printBlank . To print more characters, use a setPosition and standard output. Parameters int - position in columns int - position in rows int - any character or Constant . Color - (optional) any Color constant, default is CURRENT Return value Return type is bool . Return value is true if everything works, false if any error occurs. If coordinates are outside screen it prints nothing and returns true . Example This is example writes a horizontal symbol on specified position. Then it writes W letter if W key was pressed and hides it after release. Cursor.printChar(3, 2, DLINE_V, LIGHTBLUE); if (Keyboard.getPressed('W')) { Cursor.printChar(11, 5, 'W'); } if (Keyboard.getReleased('W')) { Cursor.printBlank(11, 5); } bool printBlank(int x, int y) This function prints blank character on specified position. To print a other characters you can use printChar . To print more characters, use a setPosition and standard output. Parameters int - position in columns int - position in rows Return value Return type is bool . Return value is true if everything works, false if any error occurs. If coordinates are outside screen it prints nothing and returns true . Example This is example creates a simple animation of X moving to right of the screen. for (int i = 1; i <= 16; i++) { Cursor.printChar(i, 0, 'X', LIGHTGREEN); Cursor.printBlank(i-1, 0); Keyboard.wait(30); } bool clearScreen() This function fills entire console with blank characters. To hide only few characters you should use printBlank . This function is a replacement for overused system(\"cls\") . It is a more clean way to clear window. Parameters This function doesn't have any parameters. Return value Return type is bool . Return value is true if everything works, false if any error occurs. Example This is example writes some text and then waits for user. After user presses a button, it clears the window. std::cout << \"Welcome in this awesome application.\"; Keyboard.waitUser(); Cursor.clearScreen(); std::cout << \"Do you want to show settings menu?\"; int getX() This function gets x coordinate of cursor. After start of the console program, cursor is automatically set to the top left corner and is moved by printing text. You can use this function if you don't know cursor coordinates, for example in functions. The best strategy is to save the position in local variable instead of calling this function in every step. Parameters This function doesn't have any parameters. Return value Return type is int . Return value is column position of cursor. Example This example prints a Kryten quote and warns the programmer that they forget to put escape character in it. std::cout << \"I knew I was lying. No silicon heaven?\" std::cout << \"Preposterous! Where would all the calculators go?\"; if (Cursor.getX() > 80) { std::cout << std::endl << \"Line is too long, try adding \\\\n in it\"; } int getY() This function gets y coordinate of cursor. After start of the console program, cursor is automatically set to the top left corner and is moved by printing text. You can use this function if you don't know cursor coordinates, for example in functions. The best strategy is to save the position in local variable instead of calling this function in every step. Parameters This function doesn't have any parameters. Return value Return type is int . Return value is row position of cursor. Example This example prints a simple rectangle at cursor position. Notice that we do not need to print end of line characters. int cx = Cursor.getX(); int cy = Cursor.getY(); for (int y = cy; y < cy+5; y++) { Cursor.setPosition(cx, y); std::cout << \"~~~~~~\"; } Color getColorForeground() This function returns printing color of the cursor. LIGHTGRAY is usually the default color. To change color instead, use Cursor.setColor(). Parameters This function doesn't have any parameters. Return value Return type is Color . Return value is color constant. Only if error occurs, return value is CURRENT. Example This example writes text only if cursor color is light gray. if (Cursor.getColorForeground() == LIGHTGRAY) { std::cout << \"You are using gray cursor color.\"; } Color getColorBackground() This function returns background printing color of the cursor. BLACK is usually the default color. To change color instead, use Cursor.setColor(). Parameters This function doesn't have any parameters. Return value Return type is Color . Return value is color constant. Only if error occurs, return value is CURRENT. Example This example changes background color for full console window to black. if (Cursor.getColorForeground() != BLACK) { Window.setColor(CURRENT, BLACK); } int getFontWidth() This function returns pixel width of font . To get number of columns in console use Window.getColumns() instead. Parameters This function doesn't have any parameters. Return value Return type is int . Return value is width of cursor in pixels. Example This example writes font size ratio to console. double cursor_ratio = (double) Cursor.getFontWidth() / Cursor.getFontHeight(); std::cout << \"Ratio is \" << cursor_ratio; int getFontHeight() This function returns pixel height of font . To get number of rows in console use Window.getRows() instead. Parameters This function doesn't have any parameters. Return value Return type is int . Return value is height of cursor in pixels. Example This example writes font size ratio to console. double scale = (double) 100 * Cursor.getFontHeight() / Window.getHeight(); std::cout << \"Your current scale is \" << scale; int getFontSize() This function returns unit height of font . The number can differ from last Cursor.setFontSize due to different console size and low integer precision. Parameters This function doesn't have any parameters. Return value Return type is int . Return value is size of cursor in pixels. Example This example sets the font to twice the size. int size = Cursor.getFontSize(); Cursor.getFontSize(size * 2); std::cout << \"Twice the power\"; string getFontType() This function returns name of console font . Only fonts with English letters will work and other characters will not be displayed correctly. Also note that Lucida Sans Typewriter font doesn't display correctly. Parameters This function doesn't have any parameters. Return value Return type is standard string . Return value is English string containing console font name. Example This function sets console font to Terminal if it is not already in use. if (Cursor.getFontType() != \"Terminal\") { Cursor.setFontType(\"Terminal\"); std::cout << \"Running in the 90's\"; }","title":"Cursor"},{"location":"wiki/cursor/#cursor","text":"Cursor writes in console window all text.

Console is an application used to run commands and executable files. Screen is the full size of working area on monitor. The position and size of console window can be changed by user or by code itself. You can use functions below to get and set these properties exactly. The console window and screen size are different for each user . When publishing an application you should account for these different screen sizes. The easiest solution is to use Window.setFullscreenBorderless and Cursor.setFontChars . The first function sets the console size to match the screen size and the second function adjusts cursor font to a given number of characters in columns and rows. For getting mouse position, use Mouse.getRows and Mouse.getCollumns instead of raw pixels. Character size When working inside a console, the most important functions are Window.getRows and Window.getColumns . You can use these functions to determine exact number of characters you can write to console. You also can set these using Window.setSizeChars . Pixel size When working with raw pixels, following six functions can be used. Functions getX and getY retrieve position of top left corner of the console window in pixels. You also can set the position with Window.setPositionCenter or Window.setPositionPixels . Window width and height in pixels are obtained using getWidth and getHeight . For resizing window in pixels you can use setSizePixels . Finally, monitor screen size can be obtained using getScreenWidth and getScreenHeight . Window can be used as following example. Window.setFullscreenBorderless(); middle = Window.getColumns() / 2; center = Window.getRows() / 2; Functions bool setSizeChars(int columns, int rows) This function sets the console window size to specified number of characters. The result depends on font size. To set the window size to fullscreen use setFullscreenWindow or setFullscreenBorderless instead. Parameters int - number of columns resized console will have rows - number of rows resized console will have Return value Return type is bool . Return value is true if everything works, else false . Setting size to low number of characters can throw an error, because the window is too small to draw navigation pane. One solution is to set higher font size . Example This example sets screen size to only 9 chars and prints a simple frame. Cursor.setFontPixels(30, 30); Window.setSizeChars(9, 9); Cursor.printChar(7, 7, 'X'); Cursor.printChar(1, 1, 'X'); Cursor.printChar(1, 7, 'X'); Cursor.printChar(7, 1, 'X'); bool setSizePixels(int width, int height) This function sets the console window size to specified pixels. Window is automatically aligned to center. Trailing characters are shown on the next lines. For new console information use getColumns and getRows . To set the window size to fullscreen use setFullscreenWindow or setFullscreenBorderless instead. Parameters int - height of new window in pixels int - width of new window in pixels Return value Return type is bool . Return value is true if everything works, else false . Example This example changes the window size three times and waits for user input after each one. Window.setSizePixels(640, 480); Keyboard.waitUser(); Window.setSizePixels(1024, 720); Keyboard.waitUser(); Window.setSizePixels(1920, 1080); Keyboard.waitUser(); bool setPositionPixels(int x, int y) This function sets the position of console window in pixels. If you want to set window position to center you can use setPositionCenter Parameters int - x pixel position of window int - y pixel position of window Return value Return type is bool . Return value is true if everything works, else false . Example This example sets the position of the window to left top third of the screen. int xpos = Window.getScreenWidth()/3 - Window.getWidth()/2; int ypos = Window.getScreenHeight()/3 - Window.getHeight()/2; Window.setPositionPixels(xpos, ypos); bool setPositionCenter() This function sets position of console window to the center of the screen. This function is called automatically after Window.setSizePixels and Window.setSizeChars . Parameters This function doesn't have any parameters. Return value Return type is bool . Return value is true if everything works, else false . Example This example sets the position of the window to center and creates a loading bar. Window.setPositionCenter(); std::cout << \"Retrieving information\" << std::endl; for(int i = 0; i <= 21; i++) { std::cout << '.'; Keyboard.wait(30); } bool setFullscreenWindow() This function sets the console size to maximum. This function doesn't hide borders, top navigation panel is still visible and also the bottom application pane. If you want to fill with console to entire fullscreen, use setFullscreenBorderless Parameters This function doesn't have any parameters. Return value Return type is bool . Return value is true if everything works, else false . Example This example resizes the window and writes three crosses in the bottom of the console. Window.setFullscreenWindow(); int middle = Window.getColumns() / 2 - 6; int bottom = Window.getRows() - 1; Cursor.setPosition(middle, bottom); std::cout << \"-x- -x- -x-\"; bool setFullscreenBorderless() This function fills the entire screen with the console size. This function hides top navigation panel and bottom application pane. This function is designed for full scale applications and games. If you want to set the console back to window use the function again or use setFullscreenWindow . Parameters This function doesn't have any parameters. Return value Return type is bool . Return value is true if everything works, else false . Example This example asks the user, if they . std::string answer; std::cout << \"Do you want to set the console to fullscreen? \"; std::cin >> answer; if (answer == \"Yes\") { std::cout << \"Console was set to fullscreen. \"; Window.setFullscreenBorderless(); } bool setColor(Color foreground, Color background) This function sets the default colors for console. You specify the foreground color and background color. This function will repaint whole window with all characters. If you want to clear all text use clearScreen . Parameters Color any color constant, text foreground color Color any color constant, text background color Return value Return type is bool . Return value is true if everything works, else false . Example This example sets the console colors as a preferred theme. std::string theme = \"blue\"; if (theme == \"blue\") Window.setColor(WHITE, BLUE); else if (theme == \"green\") Window.setColor(LIGHTYELLOW, GREEN); std::cout << \"Menu Window\" << std::endl; bool setTitle(string title) This function sets the name of the console. The text is written in console header. Function does not change the given string, meaning you can call this function without creating a string variable. Parameters string any string from standard library, string is only used as a constant. Return value Return type is bool . Return value is true if everything works, else false . Example This example sets window color and title, and writes a simple text to console.

Example This example sets console position to center if console is outside the screen. if (Window.getY() + Window.getHeight() > Window.getScreenHeight()) Window.setPositionCenter();","title":"int getY()"},{"location":"wiki/window/#int-getwidth","text":"This function returns width of the window in pixels. When calculating position of right corner of window use sum of Window.getX() and Window.getWidth() . Parameters This function doesn't have any parameters. Return value Return type is int . Return value is size in x of the window. Example This example sets the console size if console is too small. int size = Window.getScreenWidth() / 2; if (Window.getWidth() < size) Window.setSizePixels(size, Window.getScreenHeight()/2);","title":"int getWidth()"},{"location":"wiki/window/#int-getheight","text":"This function returns height of the window in pixels. When calculating position of bottom corner of window use sum of Window.getX() and Window.getHeight() . Parameters This function doesn't have any parameters. Return value Return type is int . Return value is size in y of the window. Example This example sets the screen size to match ratio of 16 : 9. int wh = Window.getHeight(); int ww = (16 * wh) / 9; Window.setSizePixels(ww, wh);","title":"int getHeight()"},{"location":"wiki/window/#int-getcolumns","text":"This function returns size of the window in columns. It is used when writing text to middle of the screen or to its corners. You can set window size in columns and rows using Window.setSizeChars() . Parameters This function doesn't have any parameters. Return value Return type is int . Return value is number of columns of the window. Example This example writes text in the middle of console width. std::string text = \"Start the application\"; int pos = Window.getColumns()/2 - text.length()/2 -1; Cursor.setPosition(pos, 0); std::cout << text;","title":"int getColumns()"},{"location":"wiki/window/#int-getrows","text":"This function returns size of the window in rows. It is used when writing text to middle of the screen or to its corners. You can set window size in columns and rows using Window.setSizeChars() . Parameters This function doesn't have any parameters.

Example This example writes a simple cross across the screen. int x = 0, rows = Window.getRows(), max = 2 * rows - 2; for(int y = 0; y < rows; y++) { Cursor.setPosition(x, y); std::cout << \"XXX\"; Cursor.setPosition(max - x, y); std::cout << \"XXX\"; x += 2; }","title":"int getRows()"},{"location":"wiki/window/#int-getscreenwidth","text":"This function returns width of the screen in pixels. If you want to set window position to center use Window.setPositionCenter() . Parameters This function doesn't have any parameters. Return value Return type is int . Return value is width of the screen in pixels. Example This example resizes the console size to the half of screen size. int screen_width = Window.getScreenWidth(); int screen_height = Window.getScreenHeight(); Window.setSizePixels(screen_width/2, screen_height/2);","title":"int getScreenWidth()"},{"location":"wiki/window/#int-getscreenheight","text":"This function returns height of the screen in pixels. It is the size of working area. You can use getBarHeight to add height of navigation bar. If you want to set window position to center use Window.setPositionCenter() . Parameters This function doesn't have any parameters. Return value Return type is int . Return value is height of the screen in pixels. Example This prints screen ratio. It uses greatest common devisor ( gcd ) from numberic, but you can write your own. #include <numeric> int width = Window.getScreenWidth(); int height = Window.getScreenHeight(); int greatest = std::gcd(width, height); std::cout << \"Your ratio is \" << width/greatest << \" : \" << height/greatest;","title":"int getScreenHeight()"},{"location":"wiki/window/#int-getbarheight","text":"This function returns height of the title bar in pixels. With this function you can determine if you are in fullscreen mode. If you want to make interactive application use Mouse.getX and Mouse.getY . Parameters This function doesn't have any parameters. Return value Return type is int . Return value is approximated height of the window title bar in pixels. Example This example asks user to hold Y key to set console to borderless mode. Then it writes a simple message. Keep in mind that the second if statement is not necessary in this small example and code can rewritten without it. std::cout << \"Hold Y to set window to borderless mode.\" << std::endl; Keyboard.waitUser(); if (Keyboard.get('Y')) Window.setFullscreenBorderless(); if (!Window.getBarHeight()) std::cout << \"You are in borderless fullscreen mode.\";","title":"int getBarHeight()"}]}
