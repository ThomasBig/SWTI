This library wraps Windows API to create a library easy to use.
It is build in C++ code for Windows operating system.
It is great for building any text based application or game.
You can watch a [showcase video](https://youtu.be/V11sTuCHC_A).

The SWTI Library is made out from 4 objects.
* **Cursor** prints colorful text on screen
* **Keyboard** checks keyboard input
* **Mouse** detects mouse position
* **Window** sets the console window size

For further information, check out the [documentation](https://thomasbig.github.io/SWTI/).


### Creating Applications
You can use the library to create fast and nice looking text interface.

### Making Games
Making games with the library is easy and fun.
It is great start for beginner programmers.

## Installation
The installation of SWTI library is easy.
Download this repository and copy the folder *SWTI/swti* to your project folder.
It contains header and source code for the library.
In your application, include a header `"#include swti/swti.hpp"`.

* **Visual Studio** - you will also need to add header and source files to your
project. Right click on the right folder *header files* and add *existing file*
and choose *SWTI/swti.hpp*. Do the same for *source files* and add *SWTI/swti.cpp*.

* **Code Blocks** - click on the left pane folders and add existing header and
source files to your project.

* **GNU Console** - You can use following command `g++ main.cpp swti/swti.cpp -o main.exe`
to compile your project. Change *main.cpp* and *main.exe* to whatever you prefer.
If you get some errors, make sure you are including the header and you can use
these flags `-static-libstdc++ -static-libgcc`.


### Hello world
You can use this simple example to ensure that SWTI library is installed correctly.
Following code writes colorful Hello world on a specified position.
It uses the Cursor object and methods setColor and setPosition.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include "swti/swti.hpp"

int main()
{
  Cursor.setColor(YELLOW);
  Cursor.setPosition(5, 2);
  std::cout << "Hello world!" << std::endl;
}
```

### Troubleshooting
If something doesn't work, try to create a new project without any additional
libraries other than SWTI. If you succeed, the problem is collision with function
names in the library. In C++ functions or objects with same names cannot be used
and namespace should be used. To solve this issue, you can create one for swti,
in which you include a header and the source file.

```c++
#include <iostream>
namespace swti
{
  #include "swti/swti.hpp"
  #include "swti/swti.cpp" // source is needed
}

int main()
{
  swti::Color color = swti::LIGHTGREEN;
  swti::Cursor.setColor(color);
  std::cout << "SWTI Works!\n";
}
```

You will need to use `swti::` prefix for every function and object.
If something still doesn't work, please add [issue](https://github.com/ThomasBig/SWTI/issues).


## Contributing
You can improve the library by contributing to it.
If you find a bug, please write it in [issues](https://github.com/ThomasBig/SWTI/issues).
You can also write a code for a new useful function and add a merge [request](https://github.com/ThomasBig/SWTI/pulls).
Keep in mind the function has to be usable in any applications or game.
Excluding too specific functions make library simple to learn and easy to use.
