# Changelog #
This changelog tracks the most important changes to SWTI.
If you downloaded new version and something doesn't work,
you find all major edits, additions and commits here.

## Version 1.4 ##
New functions Window.setDefaultColor, Window.getDefaultColor and HEX. Using
these functions you can set cursor color to arbitrary RGB or HEX value.

## Version 1.3 ##
New function Window.getConsoleTitle. It returns wstring (check previous update).
You can use wstrings with wcout std::wcout << Window.getTitle();.

## Version 1.2 ##
Functions setFontType, getFontType, setTitle now take wstring instead of string.
For example, you can call Window.setTitle(L"こんにちは世界"), L prefix signifies
the unicode string.

## Version 1.1 ##
Cursor.printChar changes text color only if color is not CURRENT.

## Version 1.0 ##
**Simple Windows Text Interface is now officially released.**

## Version 0.93 ##
Added new function Cursor.getFontSize. Use it to get font height

Added new functions hideResize and showResize to Window.
